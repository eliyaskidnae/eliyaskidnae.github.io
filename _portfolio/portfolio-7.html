title: "Pick and Place Object using Behivioural tree"
excerpt: "This project uses a Behavior Tree (BT) to manage a robot’s pick-and-place task. The robot navigates through a set of target locations, checking each for objects. When an object is found, it is classified and transported to a specific drop-off zone based on its type. The task ends after a set number of objects are collected or all points are visited. The BT structure enables modular and reactive control, making it ideal for coordinating navigation, perception, and manipulation in a flexible and robust way..
