title: "Event Based Feature Tracking using ICP"
excerpt: "This project proposes an innovative methodology for event-
based feature tracking centered around the Iterative Closest
Point (ICP) algorithm, aiming to address the computational
challenges posed by the high frequency and large volume of
events captured by these sensors.

The robot has to navigate to a list of points and in each one it has to check if there is an object on it. If there is an object, it picks it up and takes it to (-1.5, -1.5) if the object was a beer can or to (1.5, 1.5) if the object was a coke can. Once there, the robot leaves the object and goes to the next point. The task ends once two objects have been collected or all provided points have been explored.
The points where the objects can be found are:the objects can be found are:
