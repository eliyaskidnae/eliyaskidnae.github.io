Autonomous exploration and navigation in unknown environments pose significant
challenges for robotics, particularly for differential drive robots that must 
navigate dynamically and efficiently in real time. This paper introduces an enhanced 
software architecture tailored for such robots, integrating advanced technologies 
to enhance their autonomous capabilities. At the core of this system is a frontier-based
exploration strategy that leverages Rapidlyexploring Random Trees (RRT*), customized with 
a Dubin’s state space to ensure the generation of feasible and collisionfree paths. 
<br/>
The robot’s perception is powered by a high-resolution 2D Lidar,
 enabling precise detection and mapping of obstacles. 
 The path planning component of the architecture utilizes RRT* for global exploration,
  optimized through a comprehensive cost function and post-processing methods to refine
   path quality. A greedy algorithm is employed to select the next frontier to explore,
    focusing on reducing movement costs by prioritizing locally interesting locations.
This strategic approach ensures efficient coverage of unknown areas.
